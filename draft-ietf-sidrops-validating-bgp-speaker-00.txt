Signaling Prefix Origin Validation Results from an RPKI Origin 
Validating BGP Speaker to BGP Peers

             draft-ietf-sidrops-validating-bgp-speaker-00

Abstract

   This document defines a new BGP transitive extended community, 
   as well as its usage, to signal prefix origin validation results from 
   an RPKI Origin validating BGP speaker to other BGP peers. 
   Upon reception of prefix origin validation results, peers can use 
   this information in their local routing decision process.

1.  Introduction

   RPKI-based prefix origin validation [RFC6480] can be a significant
   operational burden for BGP peers to implement and adopt. In order to
   boost acceptance and usage of prefix origin validation and ultimately
   increase the security of the Internet routing system, Autonomous 
   Systems may provide RPKI-based prefix origin validation at certain
   vantage points. The result of this prefix origin validation is 
   signaled to peers by using the EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State
   Extended Community as introduced in this document.

   Peers receiving a prefix origin validation result from the validating
   EBGP peer can use this information in their local routing decision

   process for acceptance, rejection, preference, or other traffic
   engineering purposes of a particular route.

2.  EBGP Prefix Origin Validation Extended Community

    The origin validation state extended community is a Transitive 
    Four-Octet AS-Specific Extended Community [RFC5668] with the 
    following encoding:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |       0x02    |      TBD1     |   Reserved    | Global Admin  :
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       :        Global Administrator (cont.)           |validationstate|
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The value of the high-order octet of the extended Type field is 0x02,
   which indicates it is transitive. The value of the low-order
   octet (Sub-Type) of the extended Type field as assigned by IANA is 
   TBD1. The Reserved field MUST be set to 0 and ignored upon receipt 
   of this community. The Global Administrator field MUST be set to the 
   AS number of the validating BGP speaker conducting the prefix origin 
   validation. The last octet of the extended community is an unsigned 
   integer that gives the route's validation state [RFC6811]. 
   It can assume the following values:

                     +-------+-----------------------------+
                     | Value | Meaning                     |
                     +-------+-----------------------------+
                     |   0   | Lookup result = "valid"     |
                     |   1   | Lookup result = "not found" |
                     |   2   | Lookup result = "invalid"   |
                     +-------+-----------------------------+

   If the validating BGP speaker is configured to support the extensions 
   defined in this document, it SHOULD attach the origin validation 
   state extended community to BGP UPDATE messages sent to EBGP peers 
   by mapping the computed validation state in the last octet of the 
   extended

   community.  Similarly, a receiving BGP speaker, in the absence of
   validation state set based on local data, SHOULD derive a validation
   state from the last octet of the extended community, if present.

   An implementation SHOULD NOT send more than one instance of the
   origin validation state extended community.  However, if more than
   one instance is received, an implementation MUST disregard all
   instances other than the one with the numerically greatest validation
   state value.  If the value received is greater than the largest
   specified value (2), the implementation MUST apply a strategy similar
   to attribute discard [RFC7606] by discarding the erroneous community
   and logging the error for further analysis.

3.  BGP Prefix Origin Validation State Utilized at Validating Peers

   A validating BGP speaker that is aware of a BGP Prefix Origin 
   Validation state for a certain route can handle this information 
   in one of the following modes of operation:

   Simple Tagging:  The prefix origin validation state is tagged to the
       route as described in Section 2.
       
       This mode of operation is like the traditional way BGP speakers
       work, however, the prefix origin validation state 
       information is additionally available for peers.

   Dropping and Tagging:  Routes for which the prefix origin validation
       state is "invalid" (according to [RFC6811]) are dropped by the
       validating BGP speaker. Routes which show a prefix origin 
       validation state of "not found" and "valid" 
      (according to [RFC6811]) are tagged accordingly, as discussed in
       Section 2.
       
       In this mode of operation, security is rated higher than 
       questionable reachability of a prefix.
 
   Prioritizing and Tagging:  If the validating BGP speaker learned for 
       a particular prefix more than one route it removes firstly the 
       set of "invalid" routes and secondly the "not found" routes 
       unless the set of routes is empty. Based on the set of routes 
       left over the BGP best path section algorithm is executed. 
       The selected route is marked accordingly to Section 2.
       The BGP best path selection algorithm is changed by this mode of
       operation in such a way that "valid" routes are preferred even if
       they are unfavorable by the traditional best path selection
       algorithm.  This puts prefix origin validation on top of the best
       path selection.

   A validating BGP speaker MUST support the Simple Tagging operation 
   mode. Other modes of operation are OPTIONAL. The mode of operation 
   MAY be configured by the validating BGP speaker operator for all 
   connected peers, or for each BGP session with a peer separately.

   Path hiding, as originally discussed in [RFC7947], may impact 
   end-to-end connectivity for peers receiving prefixes via validating 
   peers if the best path selected contains a prefix with an "invalid" 
   prefix origin validation state, and subsequently dropped, either at
   the peer (Simple Tagging operation mode) or the validating 
   BGP speaker itself (Dropping and Tagging operation mode).

   However, these modes of operation might be used in combination with 
   [RFC7911] in order to allow a peer to receive all routes and take the 
   routing decision by itself.

4.  Signaling Prefix Origin Validation Results from a Validating Peer to
    Peers

   The EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State Community is utilized for 
   signaling prefix origin validation result from a validating BGP 
   speaker to other peers.

   This draft proposes an encoding of the prefix origin validation 
   result [RFC6811] as follows:

                  +-------+-----------------------------+
                  | Value | Meaning                     |
                  +-------+-----------------------------+
                  |   0   | Lookup result = "valid"     |
                  |   1   | Lookup result = "not found" |
                  |   2   | Lookup result = "invalid"   |
                  +-------+-----------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   This encoding is re-used. Validating peers providing RPKI-based 
   prefix origin validation set the validation state according to the
   prefix origin validation result (see [RFC6811]).

5.  Operational Recommendations

5.1.  Local Routing Decision Process

   A peer receiving prefix origin validation results from the route
   server MAY use the information in its own local routing decision
   process. The local routing decision process SHOULD apply to the
   rules as described in section 5 [RFC6811].

   A peer receiving a prefix origin validation result from the route
   server MAY redistribute this information within its own AS.
   
   In cases where multiple ASes are being administered by the same
   authority, peers MAY also redistribute this information across
   EBGP boundaries of the authority in question.  

5.2.  Validating Peers Receiving the EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State
      Extended Community

   A validating BGP speaker receiving routes from peers containing the
   EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community MUST remove 
   the extended community before the route is re-distributed to its 
   peers. This is required regardless of whether the validating BGP 
   speaker is executing prefix origin validation or not.

   Failure to do so would allow opportunistic peers to advertise routes
   tagged with arbitrary prefix origin validation results via validating

   peers, influencing maliciously the decision process of other,
   non-validating BGP speakers.

5.3.  Information about Validity of a BGP Prefix Origin Not Available at
      a Validating Peer

   In case information about the validity of a BGP prefix origin is not
   available at the validating BGP speaker (e.g., error in the ROA 
   cache, CPU overload) the validating BGP speaker MUST NOT add the 
   EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community to the route.

5.4.  Error Handling at Peers

   A route sent by a validating BGP speaker SHOULD only contain none or
   one EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community.

   A peer receiving a route from a validating BGP speaker containing 
   more than one EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community 
   SHOULD only consider the largest value (as described in Table 1) in 
   the validation result field and disregard the other values. Values
   larger than two in the validation result field MUST be disregarded.

6.  IANA Considerations

    IANA is asked to assign a Transitive BGP Opaque Extended Community
    as defined in Section 4. of RFC 7153.

7.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations described in RFC 6811 [RFC6811] fully
   apply to this document.

   Additionally, threat agents polluting ROA cache server(s) run by AS
   operators could cause significant operational impact, since multiple
   validating BGP speaker clients could be affected.  Peers should be 
   vigilant as to the integrity and authenticity of the origin 
   validation results as they are provided by a third party, namely 
   the AS operator hosting both the validating BGP speaker as well as 
   any ROA cache server(s).

   Therefore, a validating BGP speaker could be misused to spread 
   malicious prefix origin validation results. However, in the case of 
   IXPs for example, peers already trust a route server for the 
   collection, filtering (e.g. IRR database filtering), and 
   redistribution of BGP routing information to other peers.

   To facilitate trust and help with peers establishing appropriate
   controls in mitigating the risks mentioned above, AS operators SHOULD 
   provide out-of-band means for peers to ensure that the ROA 
   validation process has not been compromised or corrupted.

   While beeing under DDoS attacks, it is a common practice for peers
   connected to other Autonomous Systems to make use of blackholing 
   services. Peers are using blackholing to drop traffic, typically 
   by announcing a more specific prefix, which is under attack. 
   A peer SHOULD make sure that this prefix is covered by an 
   appropriate ROA.
